    <h2>Services Provided</h2>
    <p>We offer a dynamic, location-based platform that enables user groups to create interactive, named pinpoints on a map, each accompanied by a detailed description. Once a pinpoint is established, it becomes visible to our entire user community, who can then engage with the event by simply clicking on the corresponding map marker.</p>
    <h3>Bounty Tasks</h3>
    <p>In addition to event interaction, our platform also supports task assignment via 'Bounty Tasks'. Users can set a financial or reward-based incentive for specific tasks linked to a pinpoint. Community members can then opt to complete these tasks by selecting the pinpoint and reporting upon task completion.</p>
